This is based on the old abandoned Portuguese form Portugal language pack from lcbcruz (link [here](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/5335-portuguese-portugal-language-extension)). That language pack gives errors and has been abandoned since before I joined on beta 7 so I corrected the error updated it and added a lot more translations and extensions support.

## Compatibility

This language pack was tested with the **flarum 0.1.0-beta.12** but should work with most versions.

## Installation

It is recommended to install via composer:

```
composer require bertaveira/flarum-pt-pt
```

## Update

```
composer update bertaveira/flarum-pt-pt
php flarum cache:clear
```

## Contribute

I tried to translate as much as possible and as many extensions as possible. Some extensions are incomplete and have text in English because it was either impossible for me to find a good translation or I didn't had the patience to do so at this moment. 

Feel free to add more translations and make pull requests. I'll review them, teste them and add them to this repo and to the Packgist so everyone can use it.
